Instructions</b></font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt"><b>Introduction:</b></font></p>
<p>FilmScanData was created to provide a way to document equipment
and locations used for a particular roll of film that had been
scanned<br/>
in. It does this by allowing you to define your
inventory in the tool and you can then use this inventory to fill in
the form. When you save<br/>
the data it will create an info.txt file
which contains the form data. In the future the tool will also be
able to ‘tag’ the image files with meta <br/>
data from the data
entered. I chose a plain text, easily readable file so it can be
opened with any text viewer.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt"><b>Getting Started:</b></font></p>
<p>Upon first run of the tool, there will be no configuration file.
You will need to click the inventory button to open the inventory
form and<br/>
add cameras, lenses, films, developers, etc.. Once you
enter some equipment and click the save button a new config file will
be created<br/>
which will store your inventory. Once you close the
inventory form your equipment will be immediately available.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt"><b>Documenting Scans:</b></font></p>
<p>Once you have some inventory added and wish to put the tool to use
documenting your scanned images, just click the open button to<br/>
choose
the location of your scans. You can start choosing the equipment used
by clicking the drop-down boxes and choosing a camera.<br/>
Film,
developer, etc.. Since SLR cameras can change lenses during a single
roll of film, multiple choice is allowed for lenses so that you <br/>
may
choose all that were used for this roll of film. If you need to
remove<br/>
a lens, just double-click the entry to remove it. If you
choose a camera or other item and wish to change it you must first
delete or backspace over <br/>
the entry to remove it and this will
allow a new choice in the drop-down to be made.</p>
<p><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt"><b>Fields:</b></font></p>
<p><i>Camera</i>: What cameras was used.</p>
<p><i>Lenses</i>: Choose the lenses that were used. i.e. Nikkor 50mm
f1.4 D</p>
<p><i>Film</i>: The film stock used. i.e. Ilford Delta 100 Pro,
Ilford HP5 Plus</p>
<p><i>ISO Used</i>: What speed did you shoot the film at?</p>
<p><i>Developer:</i> What developer was used. I also like to put the
dilution. i.e. D76 1+1 or XTOL Stock</p>
<p><i>Date:</i> What was the date the file was shot? If the roll
spans multiple dates then pick the start or end date.</p>
<p><i>Film Format</i>: What format is the film? i.e. 35mm, 120, 620,
110, etc…</p>
<p><i>Film Type</i>: This is used to determine if the film is Color
Negative, Slide, or B/W.</p>
<p><i>Sheet#:</i> This is used to track the sheet number the
negatives are stored in. You can click the generate button to
generate the next number<br/>
from the last one used. Write this
number on the sheet where you can record data.</p>
<p><i>Binder#</i>: I keep my film holder sheets in a large binder and
I have filled several through the years. I am currently on number 3
so I put a 3 in to let me <br/>
know I can find these negatives in
binder 3 and sheet number listed.</p>
<p><i>Photographer</i>: Who shot the photos.</p>
<p><i>People</i>: People that may be in the photos. The idea is to
later be able to write a search tool to find all photos with John in
them. If you use a photo <br/>
manager that supports tagging you may
not be interested in these features as you can use the photo manager
to find photos. 
</p>
<p><i>Places</i>: Places where the photos were taken. Again the idea
is to be able to search later.</p>
<p><i>Notes</i>: I like to add some notes about the roll like : Dad
came in for a visit and we went to…..</p>
